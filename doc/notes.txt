Improve exception test in PermissionManager when a nonexistent folder is accessed

--

Look into refactoring IKeyValueMapper so it can be used for Mapping both ways, and maybe replace IIndexable interface, as they basically do the same thing

Perform MetadataSchema permission check on object get result

Eliminate duplication (MetadataMapping)

Remove dependencies on default types in tests

Refactor stored procedures Object_GetByGUIDs and Object_GetByFolderID (the inner join between object and ObjectRelationInfo is not necessary)
